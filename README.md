# INF 6420 - Intro to Web Development
# Erica Kelley's INF6420 Project

For my project, I will be making a portfolio site

## Wireframes

![6420 Wireframe Home Page](<Wireframes/6420 Wireframe Home Page.jpg>)

Header- I think it would be nice to have a logo or image of some sort to add interest to the header bar, then there will be a menu with buttons that go to the different pages. I have a space for a search bar at the end that I may replace because I don't know what the function of it would be in the context of this site.

Main Image- An image or background with opening text over it; maybe the logo again and then my name along with a short text blurb or quote that explains the site. I felt like it nbeeded something else so I'm including space for images or other content underneath.

![6420 Wireframe About Page](<Wireframes/6420 Wireframe About Page.jpg>)

Header Banner- The same header banner that I had from the first page will be on all pages to make navigation easier.

Header- Shows that this is the about page

Picture- A picture of me!

Text? More Pictures?- I felt like something more was needed here, so maybe a decorative image or an image description

About Text Block- Says a bit of relevant information about me

Credentials Boxes- I am thinking small boxes that can scroll to access text that notes my credentials, similar to information that would be in a resume

![6420 Wireframe Contact Page](<Wireframes/6420 Wireframe Contact Page.jpg>)

Header Banner- The same banner from the other two pages

Header- Notes that this is the contact page

Contact Box- Standard contact box to send an email to me

Smnaller Contact Boxes- Information about how to reach me, maybe anywhere from just my email to my phone number and socials as well

Side Images- more pictures for decoration
